# Google Play Store Description


TyoMmsViewer is a MMS viewer for receiving media files sent to you, and unfortunately your telecom doesn't support MMS.

For example,
If you are with Lycamobile and receive a MMS, you will see a standard text message with a link to Telstra's MMS site instead. An example text can seen as follows:

"You have a new MMS Picture or Video Message. To view your message, go to http://telstra.com/mmsview & enter User ID:61469xxxxxx and Password:1z63pg within 14 days"

This App is open-sourced, and you can find the code here: http://github.com/tyolab/t-mmsviewer
