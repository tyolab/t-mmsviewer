# TyoMmsViewer

TyoMmsViewer is a MMS viewer for receiving media files sent to you, and unfortunately your telecom doesn't support MMS.

For example,
If you are with Lycamobile and receive a MMS, you will see a standard text message with a link to Telstra's MMS site instead.

The App is developed with TyoDroid framework (git@github.com:e-tang/tyodroid-boilerplate.git)
